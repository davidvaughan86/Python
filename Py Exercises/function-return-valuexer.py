# Write a program that has a function named total_count that expects 
# a list of strings as it argument when the function is called.

# Have the returned value be a dictionary with the keys 'list_length' 
# and 'total_chars'.
# The list_length value needs to be the length of the list and 
# the total_chars needs to be the total count of characters of 
# all of the items in the array.
# Call the function 3 times with 3 different lists.
# (hint) len is usable on lists and strings.
